Create a React component for listing heroes.

1. Use the given async function to acquire a list of heroes and render them into a list.
   Heroes have ids, names and wether they are available. If a hero is available, print “Available“.
   Note to interviewer: Points for figuring out to create a type for heroes upon receiving them and to use keys for rendering a list.
2. Create a separate component for hero list items.
   Note to interviewer: We are interested in wether they can use props.
3. Add loading state as a functionality.
   Note to interviewer: If they cannot figure out a design, advise to show “Loading“ instead of the list while the function is waiting.
4. Add error handling as a functionality.
5. Create a custom hook for wrapping the fetch functionality.
